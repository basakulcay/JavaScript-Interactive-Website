DOM Events with JavaScript

    JavaScript engines register events as objects with properties and methods associated with them.
    Event handlers are registered as properties of their event object.
    Event object properties like .target, .type, and .timeStamp are used to provide information about the event.
    The .addEventListener() method can be used to add multiple event handler functions to a single event.
    The .removeEventListener() method stops specific event handlers from “listening” for specific events firing.
